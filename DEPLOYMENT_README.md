## 🎯 Recommended Deployment Path

Based on your project (2 users, transitioning from legacy system), here's the recommended approach:

### Week 1: Deploy to Railway

```bash
# 1. Push to GitHub
git add .
git commit -m "Add deployment configuration"
git push origin main

# 2. Create Railway project (via web UI)
# Follow: RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md

# 3. Deploy PostgreSQL, Backend, Frontend
# All done through Railway dashboard
```

**Result:** Your app running at `https://spisa-frontend-production.up.railway.app`

---

### Week 2-4: Testing Phase

```bash
# Manual sync weekly (Monday mornings)
sync-from-azure.bat  # Windows
# OR
./sync-from-azure.sh  # Linux/macOS/Git Bash
```

**Activities:**
- Users continue using old system
- Test new system with real data
- Train users gradually
- Fix any bugs found

---

### Week 5: Cutover

```bash
# Final sync from Azure
sync-from-azure.bat

# Verify data
# Switch users to new system
# Celebrate! 🎉
```

## 🔐 Environment Variables Checklist

### Railway Backend

```env
ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnection = <from Railway PostgreSQL service>
JWT__Secret = <generate 32+ character secret>
JWT__Issuer = spisa-api
JWT__Audience = spisa-frontend
JWT__ExpirationMinutes = 60
ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT = Production
ASPNETCORE_URLS = http://0.0.0.0:8080
```

### Railway Frontend

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL = <backend URL from Railway>
NODE_ENV = production
PORT = 3000
```

### GitHub Secrets (for automated sync)

```env
AZURE_SQL_CONNECTION = <Azure SQL connection string>
RAILWAY_DB_URL = <Railway PostgreSQL connection string>
```

## 💰 Cost Estimate

### Railway Hosting

| Service | Monthly Cost |
|---------|-------------|
| PostgreSQL (100MB) | $2-3 |
| Backend (.NET 8) | $5-7 |
| Frontend (Next.js) | $3-5 |
| **Total** | **$10-15** |

### Azure SQL Server

- **During transition:** Keep existing (current cost)
- **After cutover:** Can decommission and save money

### GitHub Actions

- **Free tier:** 2,000 minutes/month (more than enough)

3. **Next week:** Test with real users (ongoing)
4. **Next month:** Cutover to production

---

## 🎯 Key Decisions to Make

### 1. Deployment Strategy

**Question:** When to go live on Railway?

**Options:**
- **A) Deploy now, test later** (recommended)
- **B) Test everything locally first**
- **C) Wait until all features are complete**

**Recommendation:** A - Deploy now to staging environment, test thoroughly, then go live.

---

### 2. Sync Strategy

**Question:** How often to sync from Azure?

**Options:**
- **A) One-time migration** (cleanest)
- **B) Manual weekly syncs** (safest during testing)
- **C) Automated daily syncs** (for long-term parallel operation)

**Recommendation:** B during testing phase, then A for final cutover.

---

### 3. Cutover Timing

**Question:** When to switch users from old to new system?

**Options:**
- **A) Immediate** (risky but fast)
- **B) After 2-4 weeks of testing** (recommended)
- **C) Gradual user-by-user migration** (safest but slow)

**Recommendation:** B - 2-4 weeks of parallel operation, then cutover all users.
